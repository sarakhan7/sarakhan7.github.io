  <h1>Assignment 5A - HTML Summary</h1>
  <p>In this lesson, I learned how to organize my website better using unordered lists and relative links. I created an index page that links to all of my assignment files, which helped me understand how websites are structured and how navigation works. I also made sure each page had a valid title, heading, and paragraph structure. This made me realize how important good HTML formatting is, especially if I want to build professional-looking projects. Iâ€™ll apply this when I build my portfolio site or any web-based projects in the future to make sure everything is neat, easy to use, and well-organized.</p>
