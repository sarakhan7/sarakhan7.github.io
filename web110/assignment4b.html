    <h1>Assignment 4B - Security Summary</h1>

    <h2>Activity 1: Internet Safety from GCFLearnFree</h2>
    <p>This activity helped me learn how to stay safe online, especially while browsing and using websites. I used to ignore stuff like HTTPS and browser warnings, but now I understand they’re there to protect me from scams or unsafe sites. I didn’t realize how easy it is for websites to collect your data or for attackers to trick you with fake pages (phishing). One part that stuck with me was how important it is to update your browser and avoid saving passwords directly in it. Moving forward, I’m going to be more cautious about where I type my info, and I’ll probably start using private mode more often too. These tips will definitely help me stay safer while researching or applying for things online, especially as I start doing more school and job-related stuff.</p>

    <h2>Activity 2: Malware and Antivirus Tools</h2>
    <p>In this one, I learned how malware works and how antivirus programs protect against it. Before this, I honestly thought viruses were just random popups or slow computers. But now I know there are all kinds—like worms, spyware, and even ransomware that can lock you out of your files. I also tried scanning with free antivirus tools and saw how they look for threats or weird behavior. I didn’t know there was even a fake “test virus” (EICAR file) you could download to check if your antivirus works. I think this is really important because I’ve definitely clicked sketchy links before without thinking. In the future, I’ll make sure to keep my devices updated, scan them regularly, and use strong passwords so I don’t accidentally download something that messes up my laptop or steals my info.</p>
