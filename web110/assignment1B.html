      One of the activities I did was “W3Schools: Introduction to HTML.” I always kind of knew websites had code behind them, but I didn’t fully get how it worked until now. I learned that HTML is basically what builds the structure of every webpage. It’s like the outline or skeleton that everything else sits on top of. I got to see how tags like <p> for paragraphs or <img> for images actually work, and it made me realize that creating a website isn’t as complicated as I thought. It’s kind of satisfying to see a simple line of code turn into something visual. I feel like this will definitely help me in the future if I ever want to build my own portfolio site or just mess around with web projects. Even if I’m not doing front-end stuff later, it’s still good to know how websites are structured.

      Another thing I did was use the W3C Validator to check my HTML. At first I thought my code looked fine, but then I ran it through the validator and it pointed out mistakes I didn’t even notice, like missing quotation marks or tags I forgot to close. It made me realize how important it is to write clean code, because even tiny errors can mess things up. I also learned that validating your HTML helps your site work better on different browsers, which is something I never even thought about before. I can definitely see myself using this in the future, especially if I’m building a site for school, work, or even just for fun. It just makes everything more reliable and professional.
