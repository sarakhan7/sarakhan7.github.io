  One of the activities I worked on was going through the settings in Google Chrome. I didn’t realize there were so many options you could change. I tried changing my homepage, turning off pop-ups, and checking what cookies are used for. I also looked at the Chrome Web Store and added some extensions like an ad blocker and a grammar checker. This activity helped me learn that browsers can be customized a lot more than I thought. Before this, I just used Chrome to go on websites, but now I know it can also help protect my privacy and make things easier to use. I think in the future I’ll be more careful about my browser settings and also help my family use tools like password managers and privacy extensions.

  For my second activity, I tried using two different browsers, Firefox and Brave. I’ve mostly used Chrome before, so this was something new. Brave was really fast and blocked ads automatically, which I liked. Firefox looked simple and had tools that seemed good for coding and web stuff. This showed me that not all browsers are the same. I also found out that Brave is built on something called Chromium, which is what Chrome is built on too. Firefox has private browsing that doesn’t save your cookies or history. After using both, I understand why web developers test websites in more than one browser. They can show websites a little differently. I’ll probably use Brave when I want more privacy and Firefox when I’m practicing web development.
