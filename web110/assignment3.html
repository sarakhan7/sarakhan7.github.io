    <h1>Assignment 3 - Learning Summary</h1>

    <h2>Email Activity 1: Email Basics from GCFGlobal</h2>
    <p>This activity helped me understand how emails actually work and why they're still so important even though we have messaging apps. I learned how to send, reply to, and format emails correctly. One thing that stuck with me was the importance of using a good subject line and being respectful and to the point. I’ll definitely use this whenever I email professors, jobs, or for college stuff in the future.</p>

    <h2>Email Activity 2: Using Mozilla Thunderbird</h2>
    <p>I installed and tried out Thunderbird, and it was cool to see how email clients are different from just using Gmail in a browser. I learned how to check message headers, connect email accounts, and avoid spoofing. It was kind of technical, but I see how using a desktop email client can give you more control. I could use this in the future if I need to organize a bunch of emails, like during internships or for work.</p>

    <h2>Social Media Activity: Exploring Instagram and the Honeycomb Model</h2>
    <p>I went through the GCFLearnFree Instagram guide and also learned about the Honeycomb model in social media. It breaks down the 7 parts that make up any social platform, like identity, relationships, and reputation. I didn’t think about social media like that before. In the future, if I want to use platforms like LinkedIn or Instagram for networking or showing off projects, I’ll keep this in mind to build a better online presence.</p>

    <h2>Communications Activity: Using Skype and Learning About VoIP</h2>
    <p>This activity showed me how VoIP works and let me try out Skype. I used to think Skype was just old-school, but now I get how VoIP apps send voice and video over the internet. It was interesting to learn about file sharing, screen sharing, and remote desktop apps too. I can see how tools like this are useful for group projects or working from home. I’ll probably end up using VoIP a lot for internships or college collabs.</p>
