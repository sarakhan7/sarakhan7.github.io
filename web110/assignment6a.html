  <h1>Assignment 6A - Multimedia</h1>
  
  <p>
   In this lesson, I learned how to add images, videos, and audio to web pages, which makes them more engaging and fun to explore.  
  Before, I didnâ€™t really understand the difference between raster and vector graphics, but now I see why it matters for quality and resizing. 
  I generated the cat image using the Bing AI Image Generator, which helped me create custom visual content for my site.
  I also learned to use iframes to embed YouTube videos, which can help share information in a more visual way.  
  Learning these multimedia tools showed me how websites can go beyond plain text to create a better user experience.  
  I think I can apply this by making future projects more interactive, creative, and professional-looking.
