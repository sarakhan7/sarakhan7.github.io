      In this lesson, I learned that web accessibility is really important for making sure everyone can use websites, especially people with disabilities. I used tools like the WAVE checker and the W3C validator to see what was wrong with my code, like missing alt text or bad color contrast. I fixed those issues and now my website is easier for everyone to read and use. I didn’t really think about this stuff before, but now I get why it matters. I’ll try to keep using these tools in the future so my sites are more accessible to everyone.
