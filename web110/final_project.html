     In WEB110, I learned a lot about how the internet actually works beyond just browsing websites. We started with the basics, like understanding what the World Wide Web is and how it connects people all over the world through a global network of computers. I learned about how websites are built using HTML, how CSS helps style them, and how browsers like Chrome or Firefox interpret all this code. The course also introduced me to things like IP addresses, DNS servers, and the differences between websites, web browsers, and search engines. I learned how search engines crawl the web and how keywords and meta tags affect what shows up in search results. We explored concepts like web hosting, domain names, and how to publish a website online. I also learned about accessibility and why it’s important to make websites usable for everyone, including people with disabilities. Lastly, I got a basic understanding of online safety, privacy, and how to protect personal information while using the web. Overall, WEB110 gave me a solid foundation in internet fundamentals and helped me feel more confident in navigating and understanding the technology behind the websites we use every day.
