    One of the activities I did was learning how to use Boolean searches. I never even heard of that before, but it’s actually just using words like AND, OR, and NOT to get better results. I tried searching for “search engine” OR SEO and saw that it gave me a bigger range of results. I also used quotes around phrases to get exact matches, which helped when I wanted something super specific. It was cool to see how small changes in the way I search can make a big difference in what I find. Now I understand how people do deeper research without wasting time. I plan to use this in school for finding more accurate info on projects, and maybe even when I’m looking for things like job ideas or tech tutorials later on.

    Another activity I did was evaluating search results to figure out which websites are actually good sources. I followed the tips from the Georgetown guide and checked stuff like who made the site, when it was last updated, and if the info seemed biased. I compared a few sites that came up when I searched for “search engine history” and noticed that some looked kind of sketchy. Others had clear author names, good formatting, and citations. I learned that just because a link shows up high in search results doesn't mean it's trustworthy. I’ll definitely use these tips when working on school papers or any time I need to make sure I’m not just clicking on random junk. It helps me feel more confident that what I’m reading is real and not just made up.
