    Through this assignment, I learned how to analyze database relationships without using actual database software. By examining the Northwind tables, I understood how primary keys (like CustomerID) connect to foreign keys (like OrderID) to create meaningful relationships between data. This helped me answer complex questions by joining conceptual tables in my mind. I now appreciate how databases organize information efficiently - for example, separating Orders from OrderDetails prevents data duplication. These skills will help me design better websites that handle data, like an online store inventory system. Most importantly, I learned that understanding table structures is crucial before writing any queries or code that interacts with databases.
