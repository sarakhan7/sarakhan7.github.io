    <h1>Assignment 4A - Networking Summary</h1>

    <h2>Activity 1: Internet Protocols</h2>
    <p>This part taught me how devices actually talk to each other over the internet. I always assumed Wi-Fi just “magically worked,” but it turns out there’s a lot happening in the background. The internet uses different layers of communication, and I learned that TCP/IP is the main system for how stuff moves online. It splits up data into little packets and sends them around, kind of like mailing pieces of a puzzle and putting them back together on the other side. What surprised me most was how the computer keeps track of whether the whole message got there or not. I can see this being useful if I ever need to fix a connection or build apps that rely on internet stuff, like websites or games. Understanding this gives me a better idea of what’s going on when something doesn’t load or acts slow.</p>

    <h2>Activity 2: Domain Name System (DNS)</h2>
    <p>In this activity, I learned that DNS is basically the internet’s contact list. When I type a website name like "youtube.com", DNS finds the matching IP address, which is what the computer actually uses to go there. I didn’t know there were so many steps and systems involved behind that simple action. Now I get how things like DNS servers and top-level domains work. I also found out that if DNS breaks, websites won’t load, even if your Wi-Fi is fine. That explained a few tech issues I’ve had before but didn’t understand. In the future, I think this will help me if I ever build or manage websites, especially when setting up custom domains or fixing errors. It’s cool to know how the internet connects everything behind the scenes without us realizing it.</p>
