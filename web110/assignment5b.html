  <h1>Assignment 5B - CSS Styles</h1>
  <p style="color: #003366; background-color: #fdf6e3; font-family: 'Georgia', serif;">
    Learning about CSS really opened my eyes to how much control we have over the look and feel of a webpage.  
    I used to think HTML was enough, but now I understand how essential styling is for creating a good user experience.  
    I learned how to use inline, internal, and external styles, and how they each serve a unique purpose.  
    This experience helped me see how CSS can create consistent design across multiple pages,  
    and I can already see myself using these skills in future projects to make websites more organized and easier to read.
