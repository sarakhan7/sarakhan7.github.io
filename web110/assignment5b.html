  Learning about CSS really opened my eyes to how much control we have over the look and feel of a webpage. I used to think HTML was enough, but now I understand how essential styling is for creating a good user experience. I learned how to use inline, internal, and external styles, and how they each serve a unique purpose. This experience helped me understand how CSS can create consistent design across multiple pages, and I can already see myself using these skills in future projects to make my websites more organized, attractive, and easier to read.
